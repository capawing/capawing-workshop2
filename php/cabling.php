             An Ethernet crossover cable is a crossover cable for Ethernet used to connect computing devices together directly. It is most often used to connect two devices of the same type: e.g. two computers (via their network interface controllers) or two switches to each other. By contrast, patch cables or straight through cables are used to connect devices of different types, such as a computer to a network switch or Ethernet hub.

Intentionally crossed wiring in the crossover cable connects the transmit signals at one end to the receive signals at the other end. Many devices today support Auto MDI-X capability, wherein a patch cable can be used in place of a crossover cable, or vice versa, and the receive and transmit signals are reconfigured automatically within the devices to yield this desired result.</p>

               Straight-through cable is a type of twisted pair copper wire cable for local area network (LAN) use for which the RJ-45 connectors at each end have the same pinout (i.e., arrangement of conductors).

It is identical to crossover cable, except that in the latter the wires on the cable are crossed over so that the receive signal pins on the connector on one end are connected to the transmit signal pins on the connector on the other end.

Straight-through cable is also commonly referred to as patch cable. However, this might be confusing in some situations because patch cable also has a broader definition that emphasizes the fact that there is a connector on each end rather than the equality (or lack thereof) of the pinouts.

Straight-through cable is used to connect computers and other end-user devices (e.g., printers) to networking devices such as hubs and switches. It can also be used to directly connect like devices (e.g., two hubs or two switches) if the cable is plugged into an uplink port on one (but not both) of the devices. Crossover cable is used to connect two like devices without the use of an uplink port.

               An Ethernet crossover cable is a type of Ethernet cable used to connect computing devices together directly. Unlike straight-through cable, crossover cables use two different wiring standards: one end uses the T568A wiring standard, and the other end uses the T568B wiring standard. </p>
