              Packet Tracer is a cross-platform visual simulation tool designed by Cisco Systems that allows users to create network topologies and imitate modern computer networks. The software allows users to simulate the configuration of Cisco routers and switches using a simulated command line interface. Packet Tracer makes use of a drag and drop user interface, allowing users to add and remove simulated network devices as they see fit. The software is mainly focused towards Certified Cisco Network Associate Academy students as an educational tool for helping them learn fundamental CCNA concepts. Previously students they had enrolled in a CCNA Academy program could freely download and use the tool free of charge for educational use.[1] Since August 2017 with version 7.1 is free to everyone</p>

              Overview:
                 Packet Tracer allows students to design complex and large networks, which is often not feasible with physical hardware, due to costs.[7] Packet Tracer is commonly used by CCNA Academy students, since it is available to them for free.[1] However, due to functional limitations, it is intended by CISCO to be used only as a learning aid, not a replacement for Cisco routers and switches.[9] The application itself only has a small number of features found within the actual hardware running a current Cisco IOS version. Thus, Packet Tracer is unsuitable for modelling production networks. It has a limited command set, meaning it is not possible to practice all of the IOS commands that might be required
