              -->The straight tip connector features a quick-release bayonet-style connector that is cylindrical with a twist-lock coupling, 2.5-mm keyed ferrule. It was developed by AT&T and became dominant during the 1980s and 1990s for long-line systems and short-distance applications. The most prominent feature of the ST connector is the straight ferrule, a rigid plastic tube, used to hold the fiber for proper alignment for interconnection or termination.

ST connectors are spring loaded, which means they are easily inserted and removed, but one also has to make sure that they are seated properly to ensure that there is no light loss. The typical insertion loss is 0.25 dB. The connector is rated for 500 mating cycles and is usable for both single- and multi-mode fibers.</p>

                -->SMA (SubMiniature version A) connectors are semi-precision coaxial RF connectors developed in the 1960s as a minimal connector interface for coaxial cable with a screw-type coupling mechanism. The connector has a 50 Ω impedance. SMA is designed for use from DC to 18 GHz, but is most commonly used for hand-held radio and mobile telephone antennas, and more recently with WiFi antenna systems and USB software-defined radio dongles[citation needed]. It is also commonly used in radio astronomy, particularly at higher frequencies (5GHz+).

SMA connectors can be visually confused with the standard household 75-ohm type F coax connector (diameters: Male 7⁄16 inch (11 mm) circular or hex; female 3⁄8 in (9.5 mm) external threads), as there is only about a 2 mm difference overall in the specifications. Type F cannot be mated with SMA connectors without the use of an adapter.</p>
